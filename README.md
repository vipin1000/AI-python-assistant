#  Python Chatbot with Hugging Face API 🤖💬 #
Python Chatbot is a Flask web application that integrates with the Hugging Face API to provide interactive responses for Python-related queries. Using the Mistral 7B Instruct model, the chatbot is designed to help users with Python programming, offering code explanations, debugging advice, and more!

# Features:
🧑‍💻 Python Programming Expert: The chatbot can help you with coding, debugging, and offering Python-related advice.
📝 Clear and Concise Answers: It provides easy-to-understand explanations and practical code examples.
🌐 Hugging Face API Integration: Leverages the Mistral-7B-Instruct model from Hugging Face to generate high-quality responses.
🚀 Web Interface: Built with Flask, the app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
How It Works:
The app uses the Flask framework to handle user requests and interfaces with the Hugging Face API to generate responses to Python-related queries.

# The flow:
User Input: Users submit their Python-related queries via a simple web form.
API Request: The app sends the query to the Hugging Face API with a prompt that specifies the chatbot’s role as a Python expert.
Response Handling: The API returns a generated response, which is then displayed to the user.
# Key Features:
🛠️ Helps with Python Debugging: If you encounter a bug, the chatbot will help diagnose and resolve the issue.
📘 Teaches Python Concepts: Breaks down complex coding problems into simple solutions.
❌ Non-Python Queries: For any query that’s not related to Python, the chatbot will politely inform the user that it can only respond to Python-related inquiries.
